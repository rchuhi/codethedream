Pre work project
Using APIs to fetch data for a website
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the API fetch calls and create the webpages.
The Home page loads different dog images. 
The Breeds page loads breed information from a dropdown.

LOADING THE PAGE
To load the page download the index.html, breeds.html, script.js and style.css.
Put the 4 files in one folder.
Double click index.html and the home page will load
There is a link in the Navigation bar to the Breeds page and a button as well.
